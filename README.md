# flacker
This is a dockerized Alpine Linux uWSGI server running a Flask app with a ready login blueprint module. This is meant to be a quick starting point for small or <strong>BIG</strong> Flask projects from development to production.

# Quick start
Simply (after installing Docker naturally) you run:

`docker build -t flacker/latest`


`docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/www:/app/www flacker/latest`

After all the setup is done, surf to `localhost:8080`

## About
The emphasis is on security, modularity and simplicity, both of which will get better as time goes on.

### Security
The docker container and the app itself will be built as secure as possible.

### Modularity
Easy removal and configurability of shipped modules and easily replaceable front end framework.

### Simplicity
Everything will be done in the most simple way without conflicting the previous points.
